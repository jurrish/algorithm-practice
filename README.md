# Just some algorithm practice

# bubble-sort to start
--create indices to compare
--while the function iterates through the array, compare indices one at a time, and swap them out if need be, but create a temp variable first inside the for loop to "hold" the lesser value, set the lower value to the current indice, then reset the next indice to the temp variable
--time-efficiency n^2
